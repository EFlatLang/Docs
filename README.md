# Eb Language


## Introduction

Eb (Also E&#9837; or E-Flat) concretely has the following goals:

* Extensive support for metaprogramming:
  * Support for compile-time execution of arbitrary parts of a program;
  * Metaprogramming constructs leverage the full power of the Eb language;
  * Support for most features as first-class constructs, subject to the full power of the Eb language.
* Encourage a functional, declarative programming style over a procedural one.


## Name

The "Flat" in E-Flat comes from its aim to broadly support its features as first-class, which could be said to be a "flat" design since it lacks a hierarchy that makes fundamental language features incompatible. Additionally, its aim to encourage a functional and declarative programming style can be said to create a "flat" source code layout, without any hierarchy or order enforced at the language level.

The "E" in E-Flat is a reference to the language's inspirations. Its strongest inspiration is JavaScript, which is an implementation of EcmaScript, where it borrows the E. The "E" does not *stand* for Ecma as Eb is not affiliated with Ecma International in any way; it is simply a way to pay respect to its inspirations.

It bears mentioning that there is also the E programming language, to which Eb is not directly related.

Eb may be pronounced as "E-Flat" or like the word "ebb".


## File Extension

Eb files should have a `.eb` extension.
